#### What I do?
Machine Learning fascinates me a lot; Self driving car, YOLO, AlphaGo, Watson and many more, these things are so cool !! Isnâ€™t it?
My areas of interest include natural language processing and computer vision.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building SOTA Computer Vision models from scratch as my personal research work for exploration of Convolutional Neural Networks.  

#### Specialty
Open to learning more.
